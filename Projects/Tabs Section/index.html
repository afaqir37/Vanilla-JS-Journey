                            Erwin Smith (エルヴィン・スミス Eruvin Sumisu?) 
                            was the 13th commander (団長 Danchō?) of the 
                            Scout Regiment. Discerning, intelligent, 
                            and widely respected, Erwin was an able 
                            commander. While he cared deeply for his 
                            men, he did not hesitate to sacrifice them 
                            for the good and prosperity of mankind, and 
                            his men have proven more than willing to 
                            stake their lives at his order. 
                            Erwin developed the Long-Distance Enemy 
                            Scouting Formation. Due to uncertainty 
                            about his future, he later named Hange Zoë 
                            as his successor.

                            was an Eldian spy posing as a Marleyan officer in 
                            the Marley Public Security. He founded the 
                            Restorationists, and used the pseudonym the Owl 
                            (フクロウ Fukurō?) to communicate. Secretly, 
                            he possessed the power of the Attack Titan.
